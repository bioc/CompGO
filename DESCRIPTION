Package: CompGO
Title: An R pipeline for .bed file annotation, statistical comparison of GO term
    enrichment between gene sets and data visualisation
Description: This package contains functions to accomplish several tasks. It is
    able to download full genome databases from UCSC, import .bed files easily,
    annotate these .bed file regions with genes (plus distance) from
    aforementioned database dumps, interface with DAVID to create functional
    annotation and gene ontology enrichment charts based on gene lists (such as
    those generated from input .bed files), statistically compare gene ontology
    enrichment between multiple experiments and finally visualise and compare
    these enrichments using directed acyclic graphs or scatterplots. CompGO also
    enables clustering of experiments based on their GO profiles and provides
    functions for performing and visualising principle component analysis.
